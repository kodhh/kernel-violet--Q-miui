-	 * This function is fundamentally broken as currently
-	 * implemented.
-	 *
-	 * The idea is that we want to trigger a call to the
-	 * restart_block() syscall and that we want in_ia32_syscall(),
-	 * in_x32_syscall(), etc. to match whatever they were in the
-	 * syscall being restarted.  We assume that the syscall
-	 * instruction at (regs->ip - 2) matches whatever syscall
-	 * instruction we used to enter in the first place.
-	 *
-	 * The problem is that we can get here when ptrace pokes
-	 * syscall-like values into regs even if we're not in a syscall
-	 * at all.
-	 *
-	 * For now, we maintain historical behavior and guess based on
-	 * stored state.  We could do better by saving the actual
-	 * syscall arch in restart_block or (with caveats on x32) by
-	 * checking if regs->ip points to 'int $0x80'.  The current
-	 * behavior is incorrect if a tracer has a different bitness
-	 * than the tracee.
